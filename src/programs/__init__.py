Solana Programs Implementation

This module contains implementations of Solana's core programs:
- System Program: Account creation, transfers, allocation
- SPL Token Program: Token minting, transfers, accounts
- Program Derived Addresses (PDA) utilities
- Cross Program Invocation (CPI) framework

These demonstrate Solana's account-based program model where programs
are stateless and operate on accounts they own or are authorized to modify.
