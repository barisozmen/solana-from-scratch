"""
Sealevel Parallel Execution Implementation

This module implements Solana's revolutionary Sealevel runtime:
- Dependency analysis: Transaction conflict detection using account access patterns
- Account locking: Readers-writer locks for safe parallel execution
- Batch scheduling: Grouping non-conflicting transactions for simultaneous execution
- Performance monitoring: Comprehensive metrics and optimization tracking

Sealevel enables Solana to process thousands of transactions simultaneously
by leveraging the account model's explicit dependency declarations.
