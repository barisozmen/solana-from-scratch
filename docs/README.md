# Building a Minimal Solana-Like Blockchain from Scratch in Python

> A comprehensive, educational journey through blockchain fundamentals with Python elegance.

## Course Overview

Welcome to an extraordinary journey where we'll build a simplified, educational version of Solanaâ€”a high-performance blockchain emphasizing speed, scalability, and innovative features like Proof of History (PoH). As Peter Norvig would approach it: with clarity, modularity, and elegant design.

### What You'll Build

By the end of this 8-stage course, you'll have a minimal working blockchain that supports:

- **Networked nodes** with peer-to-peer communication
- **Transactions** with cryptographic signatures  
- **Consensus** using simplified Tower BFT
- **Basic smart contracts** with a simple runtime
- **Solana-inspired features**:
  - Proof of History (PoH) for timing
  - Proof of Stake (PoS) for validation
  - Tower BFT for consensus
  - Turbine-like block propagation
  - Gulf Stream-like mempool forwarding
  - Sealevel-inspired parallel execution

### Course Philosophy

Each stage builds incrementally, introducing new concepts while ensuring the system remains functional. We emphasize:

- **Clarity over complexity** - Simple, readable Python code
- **Modularity** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Testing** - Each stage includes working examples
- **Education** - Focus on understanding, not production readiness

### Prerequisites

- Basic Python proficiency
- Understanding of data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming
- Basic cryptography concepts (helpful but not required)

### Required Libraries

```bash
pip install ecdsa
```

For networking stages, Python's built-in `asyncio` and `json` are sufficient.

## Stage Progression

| Stage | Focus | Estimated Time | Key Concepts |
|-------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| [Stage 1](stage-01.md) | Basic Block Structure | 1-2 hours | Blocks, hashing, chain validation |
| [Stage 2](stage-02.md) | Proof of History | 2-3 hours | PoH, verifiable delay, timestamping |
| [Stage 3](stage-03.md) | Transactions & Mempool | 3-4 hours | ECDSA signatures, transaction processing |
| [Stage 4](stage-04.md) | Validators & Staking | 3-4 hours | PoS, leader selection, stake-weighted voting |
| [Stage 5](stage-05.md) | Tower BFT Consensus | 4-5 hours | Fork handling, voting, consensus |
| [Stage 6](stage-06.md) | Networking & Gossip | 5-6 hours | P2P, gossip protocol, block propagation |
| [Stage 7](stage-07.md) | Smart Contracts | 4-5 hours | Programs, runtime, execution |
| [Stage 8](stage-08.md) | Parallel Execution | 5-6 hours | Sealevel-like parallel processing |

**Total Estimated Time:** 27-35 hours

## Getting Started

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository>
   cd solana-from-scratch
   pip install ecdsa
   ```

2. **Start with Stage 1**
   - Read [Stage 1 Documentation](stage-01.md)
   - Implement the basic block structure
   - Run the provided tests

3. **Progress Sequentially**
   - Each stage builds on the previous
   - Test thoroughly before moving forward
   - Use version control to checkpoint progress

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use Python's `dataclasses` for immutable structures
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions pure where possible
- Use type hints for clarity

### Testing Strategy
- Each stage includes a `__main__` test script
- Run tests after each implementation
- Validate chain integrity at every stage
- Add unit tests for complex functions

### Error Handling
- Start simple, add robustness incrementally
- Focus on happy path first
- Add error handling in later stages
- Use Python's exception system appropriately

## Key Insights You'll Gain

1. **Blockchain Fundamentals** - How blocks link and validate
2. **Cryptographic Signatures** - Securing transactions with ECDSA
3. **Consensus Mechanisms** - From simple chains to Byzantine fault tolerance
4. **Network Protocols** - P2P communication and gossip
5. **Distributed Systems** - Handling forks, votes, and state synchronization
6. **Smart Contracts** - Programmable blockchain logic
7. **Performance Optimization** - Parallel execution and throughput

## Beyond the Course

After completing all stages, consider exploring:

- **Real Cryptography** - Use production-ready libraries
- **Performance Benchmarking** - Measure throughput and latency
- **Advanced Consensus** - Implement full Tower BFT
- **Production Features** - Add monitoring, logging, persistence
- **Integration** - Connect with existing blockchain tools

## Support and Resources

- Each stage includes detailed implementation notes
- Code examples are fully functional
- Common issues and solutions are documented
- Extension ideas for further learning
