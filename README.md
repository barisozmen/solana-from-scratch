## 🎯 Learning Approach

This course follows Peter Norvig's philosophy of clarity and elegance:

- **Incremental building**: Each stage is functional and testable
- **Clean code**: Readable Python with type hints and documentation  
- **Practical examples**: Working code you can run and modify
- **Deep understanding**: Learn the "why" behind each design decision

## 🛠️ Key Technologies

- **Python 3.8+**: Clean, readable implementation
- **ECDSA**: Cryptographic signatures for transactions
- **AsyncIO**: Non-blocking networking and I/O
- **Multiprocessing**: Parallel transaction execution
- **JSON/Hex**: Data serialization and encoding

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Demo

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd solana-from-scratch

# Install dependencies
pip install ecdsa psutil

# Run Stage 1 example
python -c "
from docs.examples.stage1_blockchain import *
bc = Blockchain()
bc.add_block('Hello, Blockchain!')
print('Chain valid?', bc.is_valid())
"
```

## 🚧 Course Philosophy

> *"The best way to understand any system is to build it from first principles."*

- **Clarity over complexity**: Simple, understandable implementations
- **Education over production**: Focus on learning, not deployment
- **Hands-on experience**: Build, test, and experiment
- **Progressive complexity**: Master each concept before moving forward

## 📈 Expected Results

By the final stage, your blockchain will achieve:
- **1,000-10,000+ TPS** (depending on hardware)
- **Byzantine fault tolerance** with malicious validator handling
- **Smart contract execution** with account-based programs
- **Full P2P networking** with distributed consensus
